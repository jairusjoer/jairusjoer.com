Improvements to reach 95+ ￼

1. Executive summary and essentials at top.

 ▫ 2–3 lines with role, scope, domains, core outcomes (modernization, DX, accessibility), plus location, work authorization, languages, and priority links.

 ▫ Surface Portfolio ↗ prominently.

2. Quantify impact with business and reliability metrics.

 ▫ Build/CI: “Cut build times 50%+ and CI throughput +35%, saving 18 engineer‑hours/week; deployment frequency +2.1×; MTTR −40%.”

 ▫ Monorepo: “Unified 12 repos; reduced duplicated tooling by 80%; standardized pipelines, cutting new‑service setup from 2 days to 3 hours.”

 ▫ Design system: “Adoption across 4 product lines; 70% component reuse; reduced UI defects −32%; time‑to‑feature −25%.”

 ▫ Temporal automation: “Eliminated 95% manual accounting steps; reduced reconciliation errors −60%; batch throughput +3×; SLA from 48h to 8h.”

3. Clarify leadership scope and collaboration.

 ▫ Add team sizes, stakeholders, and ownership level: “Led 6 engineers; partnered with Head of Product and Design; authored 8 RFCs; drove org‑wide standards.”

4. Tighten structure and consistency.

 ▫ Remove duplicate headings and “▼”; keep one clean section set.

 ▫ Unify tense: past for completed roles; present for current.

 ▫ Replace ampersands with “and”; consistent punctuation.

 ▫ Standardize date formats.

5. Consolidate and prioritize skills.

 ▫ Group by domains with proficiency indicators (Expert/Advanced/Working).

 ▫ De‑duplicate and emphasize differentiators: Rspack/Turborepo/Temporal, WCAG 2.1, Storybook/Style Dictionary, Vue/TypeScript, GraphQL, testing (Playwright/Jest/Vitest), CI/CD, Docker.

 ▫ Consider removing niche or legacy tools unless relevant to target roles.

6. Resolve education entries.

 ▫ Merge “Media Designer Apprentice” with “Media Design Apprenticeship” into one, with institution, exact dates, and the 95/100 distinction.

7. Add award context.

 ▫ “BCM Content Platforms B2C Gold (2022) — German ‘Best of Content Marketing’ award; recognized for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), performance (95+ Lighthouse), and audience engagement.”

8. Elevate accessibility and testing outcomes.

 ▫ Include audits passed, defect trends, assistive tech testing, test coverage tied to reliability: “95%+ coverage correlated with escaped defects −28%; a11y audits: 0 critical violations across releases.”

9. Results‑first rewrites for key bullets.

 ▫ HERO example:

 ⁃ “Modernized frontend via Rspack migration, cutting build times 52% and cold start −41%, enabling +2× daily deploys and faster incident recovery.”

 ⁃ “Established design tokens and Storybook; 70% component reuse and −25% feature cycle time across 4 surfaces.”

 ⁃ “Automated accounting workflows with Temporal; reduced reconciliation SLA from 48h to 8h and error rate −60%.”

 ▫ neuwaerts example:

 ⁃ “Grew organic traffic +120% YoY through performance, structured content, and SEO; improved conversion +14%.”

10. Add concise “Selected Projects” with outcomes.

 ▫ 3–4 entries with one‑line metrics (users, uptime, revenue/efficiency gains) to complement roles.

11. Include links and artifacts.

 ▫ Architecture RFCs, design system Storybook, accessibility audit summary, and a small case study for “Stock Management” module.

12. Minor phrasing trims.

 ▫ Reduce adjectives (“championed,” “cutting‑edge”) in favor of measurable results; keep bullets compact.
