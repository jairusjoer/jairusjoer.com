## In October 2022 we published our first article

On 2 October 2022, we published our first article - [Include Alpine.js in a production environment](/archive/aggregata/include-alpine-js-in-a-production-environment) - and take this as an opportunity to review Aggregata after one year.

While we report on our progress, we also want to give an outlook on future projects and what readers can expect from Aggregata in the future.

### Highlights from the past year

- **29 articles** were published by us. Pretty much one article every two weeks.
- **2500 readers** are now reached every month. A monthly increase of ~200.
- **1 seminar** we held for +15 people at neuwaerts.

### Further developments

It’s not just our content that has gotten better and reached more people. Our website has also undergone major changes in the past year.

In addition to a completely revamped design, we added important features for the availability and accessibility of our content, among other things.

The focus here was on **multilingualism**. Being able to offer our content not only in German but also in English has sustainably expanded our readership. In parallel, we set up an **RSS feed** to distribute our content on [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/).

We have continuously added more modules to our content. An eye-catcher are the **interactive plots** with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/), which now accompany the presented examples with the expected data.

### Outlook

In the future, we will not only publish articles on Aggregata, but also on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) on the topics of web, applications and artificial intelligence.

Our [experiences from the first seminar](/archive/aggregata/how-does-ai-learn-impressions-from-our-first-seminar/) have led us to expand this format in the future and strive for even more successful knowledge communication.

In the long term, this will also have a positive impact on the website and its content, as we will incorporate the expertise gained into our content and the expansion of the website.

So, as expected, the next article will follow in two weeks. This time it’s about how to set up and deploy your next project with Astro.
