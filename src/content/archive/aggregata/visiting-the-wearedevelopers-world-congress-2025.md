## Wednesday

As I did last year, I arrived on Wednesday to take part in the pre-check-in event. Shortly before the event itself, we visited a local Latin American restaurant in preparation for the evening ahead, which featured events organised by CARIAD and other hosts.

## Thursday

As usual, Thursday marked the opening day of the congress, featuring a keynote by GitHub's CEO, Thomas Dohmke, who attempted to demonstrate the improved capabilities of GitHub Copilot. Rather amusingly, this demonstration did not go as smoothly as expected, however.

This year, I am focusing on a mix of holistic and in-depth topics in order to strike a balance between leadership and developer experience, and to develop my capabilities further in line with my promotion to a senior engineering position.

Unlike last year, this time I will summarise my favourite sessions from each day and share what I learnt from each one. As my last article was rather superficial, I expect this one to be more valuable.

### [Web-Fragments: incremental micro-frontends migration approach for enterprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD-KkXAJY_U)

This session helped me to bridge the gaps that I have been exploring in recent weeks regarding monoliths for my article series, '[_Migrating the Monolith_](/archive/aggregata/migrating-the-monolith-i-conceptualization/)', as well as helping me to develop a concept for decoupling frontends and easing migration into new stacks for existing applications.

### [Possibilities with Web Capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlNccgqSzbQ)

As an [advocate of native web capabilities](/archive/aggregata/the-future-of-the-web-might-be-native/), I found this session particularly enlightening. It broadened my understanding of the offerings available and reaffirmed my belief that it provides a practical and future-proof foundation for developing capable web applications.

### [ShapeShift: Reinventing Agile for a B2B SaaS Scale-Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AI56iglIks)

Although I am biased towards this session, I would still like to point out that this session successfully condenses our current in-house approach to cycles into a brief 5-minute overview, offering a concise yet accessible insight into our processes.

## Friday

|     | 09:40 – 10:10 | Outsmarting the System: What Game Cheaters Can Teach Us About Cyber Security |
| ★   | 10:20 – 10:50 | End-to-End TypeScript: Completing the Modern Development Stack               |
| ★   | 11:00 – 11:30 | Oh S\*\*\*! There's a New Accessibility Law and I'm Not Ready!               |
|     | 11:40 – 12:10 | Client-Side State Management Reimagined – Think Outside the Box              |
| ★   | 13:00 – 13:30 | Building Developer Experience - Brick by Brick                               |
|     | 14:20 – 14:50 | Building a framework-independent component library                           |

### [End-to-End TypeScript: Completing the Modern Development Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82IIetQ808)

Recently, I explored various TypeScript-based stack combinations and found some solutions to outstanding problems in this session, such as unified type definitions and validation with [Zod](https://zod.dev/), and how to integrate them in an agnostic backend environment like [Hono](https://hono.dev/).

### [Oh S\*\*\*! There's a New Accessibility Law and I'm Not Ready!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h03tv2oTqG4&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.wearedevelopers.com)

[Accessibility is not an afterthought](/archive/aggregata/accessibility-a-necessity-not-an-afterthought/). That has been my credo for some time now, and this talk has expanded my existing knowledge of testing approaches and tools, providing a more refined and robust foundation for future implementations internally as well as externally.

### [Building Developer Experience - Brick by Brick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB1gyitYUbI&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.wearedevelopers.com)

The LEGO Group's shift into the digital realm began decades ago with Lego Island, a favourite of mine, and has continued with an astonishing number of developers whose knowledge must be managed and preserved. They presented this in a lovingly crafted presentation to follow.

## Reflection

This year was different. To be completely honest, some of the talks felt rather superficial and basic, which left me feeling rather unsatisfied. Nevertheless, I managed to gain valuable insights from the sessions I marked as favourites, and I wholeheartedly recommend them.

Another difference was our presence at the congress. Our group doubled in size, we had our own booth and held a session, and we were frequently recognised by other attendees and exhibitors, most likely due to our eye-catching display of group size and colour.

Overall, I would rate this year's congress as a success, and I hope to have the privilege of attending again next year. Special thanks to my colleagues, and in particular to Lennart, for accompanying me to, from and around the congress.

## TL;DR

At WeAreDevelopers 2025, I enjoyed standout sessions on micro-frontends, additions to the modern tech stack, team development and developer experience. Despite some superficial sessions in-between, these provided meaningful takeaways.
