Earlier this year, Read.cv announced that its design and engineering team had been acquired by Perplexity. As a result of this acquisition, Read.cv is winding down operations and will cease operations on May 16, 2025.

Read.cv set itself apart from other professional networks by offering an experience focused monstly on the self. Aside from the exploration feed, there was no constant stream of posts flooding the page every time visited.

Just you and the resume you were reading, a minimalist yet comprehensive list of personal accomplishments, adorned by the casual accomplice of images or articles detailing the process of the craft. A truly reduced experience.

It's this reduced yet refined experience that has delighted me and led me not only to shape my own resume, but more importantly, to wander around and stumble upon other resumes, frequently and almost daily, without boredom in sight.

I've discovered many talented artists, designers, and developers, as well as professions I usually admire from afar, such as interior design, furniture making, and more. The plethora of diversity in its creators invaluably enriched my creative journey.

As May 16th draws closer by the day, I find myself spending more and more time preserving the people I've found while trying to capture the essence of an amazing platform that will soon be gone.

In this endeavor, I'm answering the call to _carry the torch_ and rebuild my own resume in the spirit of Read.cv. I'm currently researching a possible candidate that uses Astro to display and manage its content, and hope to share it soon.

In the meantime, I'll be spending some more time on Read.cv, reading the resumes of great people and adding their homepages to my ever-growing list of bookmarks, which I hope to share on my new resume soon.

I highly recommend browsing Read.cv while it's still online. No new content can be posted, so it serves as a snapshot of the community as it was in February 2025. Who knows what gems you might unearth in this frozen place.

I'll leave you with three resumes from my extensive collection of bookmarks that I return to time and again for inspiration. _Please try to enjoy each resume equally, and not show preference for any over the others._
