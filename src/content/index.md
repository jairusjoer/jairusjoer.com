I am a **Senior Full Stack Developer** and **Designer** based in Germany. I take great delight in my specialized work surrounding user experience, design systems, and accessibility, always striving to create intuitive and inclusive digital experiences.

I have delivered measurable impact for tens of thousands of customers: cutting build times by 50%+, growing organic traffic by 120% YoY with a 33% conversion lift, and driving design system adoption across dozens of teams at various companies.

I am currently spearheading HERO Software's platform modernization through monorepo orchestration and design system adoption. I am committed to design and engineering excellence, sharing these values with my colleagues.
