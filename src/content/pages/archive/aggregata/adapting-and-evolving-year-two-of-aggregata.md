2024 was a big year for machine learning, with advancements in large language models like [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) and [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b), and improvements in image understanding using neural networks.

As Aggregata enters its second year, we're reflecting on the incredible progress we've made. Let's dive into the key changes we've implemented.

### Improvements to our website

We've implemented several quality-of-life improvements, including:

- Recommended articles: Every post now has relevant articles to help users explore further.
- Table of contents: This makes it easier to navigate and understand the content.
- Filter: Users can now easily select specific areas of interest.

These features enhance user experience and improve the platform's overall functionality.

### Improvements to our content

We're updating our content to keep up with the tech curve or stay ahead! Here's what's new:

- Web: As part of an intensified learning curve, we explored [design systems](https://aggregata.de/develop-design-systems-with-accessibility-in-mind/) and their underlying definitions, [accessibility](https://aggregata.de/accessibility-a-necessity-not-an-afterthought/) and its general application on the web, and lastly increased the number of entries in one of our favourite series, [Alpine.js](https://aggregata.de/dynamic-imports-with-alpine/).
- Machine Learning Deep Dive: We explored reinforcement and unsupervised learning, with articles on [Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning](https://aggregata.de/actor-critic/), [Random Projections](https://aggregata.de/random-projections/), and pre-trained transformers like [Matcha-Quarta](https://aggregata.de/matcha-quarta/).

This means you'll have even more valuable resources to learn about the latest technologies.

### Our year in numbers

**25** Articles were published this year. Pretty much one article every two weeks.

**8,450** Readers are now reached every month. A monthly increase of ~500.

### Upcoming Improvements

Building on the current success of Aggregata, we can now focus on more complex topics. As a first step, we're taking a look at how we can better use pre-trained transformers to generate the environment around our articles, such as finding sources for information, generating article cover images, or other fields.

We're also looking to upgrade our content management system (CMS) to meet the increasing demands of both ourselves and our readers. Our new site therefore will run on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/).

As for our next article, we plan to build on our [recent article on component libraries](https://aggregata.de/define-a-component-library-for-designers-and-developers/) with Create a Component Library for Designers and Developers. Look out for it in the next two weeks.
