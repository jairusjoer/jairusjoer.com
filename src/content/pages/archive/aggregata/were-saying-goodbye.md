Dear everyone,

Aggregata, our primary side project over the past three years, will be discontinued on December 10th, 2025. This has not been an easy decision, but it reflects a mix of practical and philosophical reasons that have grown clearer over time.​

## Why we are stopping

- **Interaction**: Despite frequently inviting feedback, we received very little from our community, which made it hard to iterate and improve on what was already there, even though we still believe the baseline quality of our work was solid.
- **Impact**: A core ambition of Aggregata was to help people expand their knowledge and skills by opening up our own knowledge base, but the impact never reached a level where this felt truly fulfilled from our perspective.
- **Numbers**: While visitor numbers have grown in recent months, they remain far below what would be needed to run the site at net‑zero cost. After three years of operating at a loss, we no longer see a realistic path to cost‑neutrality within the next few years.​

## Our stance on technology

Over the years, we have seen technologies, and especially artificial intelligence, go through periods of excitement and disillusionment. We recognize that the current use and deployment of neural networks and related systems give rise to a number of ethical and societal concerns for us, particularly in cases where these technologies are used in ways that may cause more harm than good.

We would like to express our desire for Aggregata to avoid being part of this cycle or being passively associated with developments that we have fundamental questions about. If we were to consider stepping back from this field and this project, it could be an opportunity to align our work more closely with our values.

## What happens to the site and your data

To ensure a seamless experience for our valued readers, the website will be transitioned into a static archive, accessible via a dedicated link on the landing page, allowing continued access after December 10th, 2025. It is with a heavy heart that we must inform you that no new content will be added, and interactive features will be disabled.

As part of the shutdown process, all user data associated with Aggregata, such as accounts, profiles, comments, and any other personally identifiable information, will be permanently deleted. It is with a heavy heart that we must inform you that this deletion will be irreversible. Unfortunately, no backups containing personal data will be retained.

## Thank you

We have found the process of creating and maintaining Aggregata to be a meaningful experience. While it has not grown into what we had originally envisioned, we are grateful for the journey. To all those who have taken the time to read, share, or quietly appreciate our work over the years, we extend our sincere gratitude for your consideration and attention.

We wish you all the best for the future
**Henrik & Jairus, your authors at Aggregata**
