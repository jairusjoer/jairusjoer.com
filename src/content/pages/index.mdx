I am a Full Stack Developer and Design Systems Expert from Germany, creating scalable architectures and cohesive design systems that enhance product quality. My work spans technical innovation, component libraries, and business-critical implementations.

Throughout my career at HERO Software, neuwaerts, and as Co-Founder of XVI CHAPEL, I've led transformative initiatives that improved developer experience and build performance by connecting technical excellence with business value.

At HERO Software, I spearhead platform modernization and mentor colleagues in internal working groups, championing new technologies. Outside work, I contribute to my blog, Aggregata, while creating accessible, consistent digital experiences.
