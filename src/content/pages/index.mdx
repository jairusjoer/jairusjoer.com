I am a Full Stack Developer and Designer from Germany. Focused on creating consistent and clear design systems for rich, beautiful products.

Full Stack Developer at neuwaerts, Co-Founder of XVI CHAPEL, Marketing Manager at World of Bass and Freelance Designer & Developer - over the past decade I have had the delight of experiencing many facets of the design industry.

Today I work at [HERO Software](https://hero-software.de). In my spare time I contribute to [aggregata.de](https://aggregata.de).
