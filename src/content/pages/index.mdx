<span class="sr-only">Curriculum Vitae of Jairus Joer – Senior Full Stack Developer & Design Systems Specialist</span>



I scale platforms, modernize architecture, and accelerate reliable delivery. I bridge the gap between frontend systems, performance, accessibility, and DX, as well as backend, data, and workflow orchestration for true end-to-end ownership.

**Key outcomes**: 50%+ build reductions, multi-year design system adoption, monorepo standardization, 95+ Lighthouse quality baselines, WCAG 2.1 accessibility, and high-performing technical content reaching 9,000+ monthly readers.

**Focused on**: architectural modernization, design token pipelines, performance & DX optimization, accessibility, workflow automation (Temporal), and scalable component ecosystems that compound engineering productivity.
